<ins>Quantitative vs Qualitative Data Analysis</ins>

* Quantitative research = focuses on numbers, measurement, and statistics. It aims to test hypotheses, measure variables, and (often) generalize results to a larger population.
* Qualitative research = focuses on words, meanings, and experiences. It aims to explore peopleâ€™s perspectives, motivations, and contexts in depth, often with smaller groups.
* Connection: Qualitative research can help identify important themes/variables, which can later be tested with quantitative methods.
